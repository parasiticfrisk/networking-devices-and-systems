# Description: Primality test algorithms
#              Generates a list of prime numbers in a user specified range
#              provided at run time. The user can select from naive,
#              Miller-Rabin, or Fermat primality tests. Only the specified test
#              is run.
#
#              This code uses Dispy on OctaPi using the recommended method for
#              managing jobs efficiently. For more information, visit the Dispy
#              website.
