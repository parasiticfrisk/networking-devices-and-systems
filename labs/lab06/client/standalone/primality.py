# Description: Primality test algorithms
#              Generates an endless list of prime numbers from a starting value
#              provided at run time. Both Miller-Rabin and Fermat have to be
#              true for the value to be assumed to be prime. It runs on the
#              OctaPi client standalone and is intended to check that the
#              primality testing code used in several other apps is working
#              correctly.
