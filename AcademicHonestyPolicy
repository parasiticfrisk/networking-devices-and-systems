Academic Honesty Policy

I understand that plagiarism means copying someone elseâ€™s work and presenting the
work as if it were my own, without clearly attributing the original author.

I understand that plagiarism is an act of intellectual dishonesty, and that people
usually get kicked out of university or fired from their jobs if they get caught
plagiarizing.

Aside from using open source libraries, and short snippets of code which are clearly
attributed to their original author, 100% of the code in my projects was written by
me, or along with another programmer with whom I was pair programming in real time.
